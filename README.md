# What is a TSP?
Travelling-Salesman-Problem or TSP describes the problem of finding the shortest path between a set number of points. The goal is to visit each point once before returning to the starting point. The problem is to find the shortest route to do so.

# What is a genetic algorithm?
A genetic algorithm is an algorithm modelling an evolution of solutions. It consists of a certain number of possible solutions to a given problem and evaluates them using a fitness criterion. Then it crosses and mutates these solutions and sorts out weaker ones. This is repeated up to a termination criterion.

# How to use this project?
After obtaining all files, you obviously need a way to run java code on your device. Just use Google if you don't know how. The file you want to run then is the TSP.java file: it contains the main function of the project. Everything further than that you have to figure out yourself but i think it's pretty self explaining.
